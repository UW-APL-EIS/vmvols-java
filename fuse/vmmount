# Stuart Maclean: A driver script for mounting VM disks on the host.
# Currently understands .vdi and .vmdk file formats, so should be able
# to handle VirtualBox and (non-esxi/vmfs) VMWare managed VMs.
#
# Usage: vmmount /path/to/vm1 (/path/to/vmN)* mountPoint
#
# For options, invoke with -h, e.g.
#
# vmmount -h
