 *
 * A stream-optimized VMware virtual disk is one where grains
 * (nominally, 64K of data) are each compressed, for the purposes of
 * moving the data across networks.  The MonolithicStreamOptimizedDisk
 * is the .vmdk variant you get when
 *
 * Exporting a VM to .ovf/.ova file formats
 *
 * Build a VM with Vagrant (@see https://www.vagrantup.com)
 *
 * Obviously we cannot write to a monolithicstreamoptimizeddisk, since
 * it would need unzipping on the fly, not something we are interested
 * in.
