 * A base class for all (two!) the virtual machine managers whose disk
 * formats we support: VirtualBox and VMWare (host-based, not esxi/vmfs,
 * etc) .
 *
 * Example: for a virtual machine (perhaps a VirtualBox one) in dir
 * 'M' with a single virtual hard disk, this code gets us access to
 * the disk as a 'device file', i.e. whole disk (not any partitions,
 * use Sleuthkit for volumeSystem/partition traversal)).
 *
 <code>
 VirtualMachine vm = VirtualMachine.create( "/path/to/M" );
 List<VirtualDisk> vds = vm.getActiveDisks();
 VirtualDisk vd = vds.get(0);
 </code>
 *
 * Note that this is a 'pure-Java' implementation.  We have pure-Java
 * file format parsers for VirtualBox and VMware (host-based products
 * like Workstation, not any vmfs/ESX-originating disks).  There is no
 * JNI portion binding to any VM engine libraries.  In fact to use
 * this Java API, the VM software need not even be present.  All we
 * need are the .vdi/.vmdk files themselves.
 *
 * @see virtualbox.VBoxVM
 * @see vmware.VMwareVM
