 * Preallocated base image file of a fixed size.  In VirtualBox C
 * code, this is type VDI_IMAGE_TYPE_FIXED.
 *
 * Although a FixedDisk still has a 'block map' near the head of the
 * host disk file, the block map is essentially a no-op, or perhaps
 * better thought of an identity function.  All the space for the
 * virtual disk's entire content is pre-allocated in the host file, so
 * no block map indirection is needed.  A FixedDisk disk size is then
 * the size of the virtual disk plus any leading data structures like
 * the header and block map.  In fact:
 *
 * host disk file size = virtual disk size + header.dataOffset.
 *
 * @see FixedDiskTest for unit tests on FixedDisk data files.
